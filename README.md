# locomotivecms-engine-docker

Container for the LocomotiveCMS Engine. LocomotiveCMS Engine is the Ruby on Rails engine used to serve
LocomotiveCMS sites in production. This container is entirely self-sufficient, including both the Engine and MongoDB.

This recipe is currently intended for local development - using it in production would require additional configuration.
